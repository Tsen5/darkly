Try to upload a file that is not an image .jpeg (a message "Your image was not uploaded." will appear).

Open firefox dev tools, go to Network, and find the POST request corresponding to your upload.

Select it then click on "Edit and send". In the request body, you should find "Content-Type: text/php", change it to "Content-Type: image/jpeg".

Send it, then right click on it to open it in a new tab. The flag will appear.
